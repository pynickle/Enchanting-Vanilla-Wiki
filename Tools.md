### **1.** *Slime Chunk Detecting*
* You can right-click a frog with a bucket to get a frog bucket.
* When you come to the Slime chunk with a frog bucket in your inventory, the frog bucket will be animated.

### **2.** *Compress Slime Block*
* Now you can make it compress into a compressed Slime block by placing an anvil on top of two consecutive slime blocks above and below.
* It's more sticky, and you can bounce higher and higher on it

### **3.** *Sculk Compass(Biome Finder)*

#### Material Acquisition
* You have a chance to find a damaged sculk compass in an Ancient City chest, use Echo Shards and Amethyst to repair it.
* You can swipe suspicious blocks for a chance to get different types of biome crystals.
* You can manually convert these biome crystal types (refer to tooltip).

#### Crystal Identification
* You can craft an Appraisal Table to bind biome crystals to random biomes.
* The selected biome must match the temperature of the biome crystal and be located in the same dimension as the appraisal table.
* The first appraisal does not require diamonds. Subsequent appraisals can be performed using diamonds, but the probability of obtaining previously appraised results decreases.

#### Usage Method
* Place the biome crystal in your offhand and the sculk compass in your main hand, long press to use it and the compass will point to the biome corresponding to the biome crystal.
* There is a 1% chance that it will explode and lose your biome crystal, and the sculk compass will also be destroyed.
* Throw the sculk compass into Soul fire to remove its bindings.
* The sculk compass will randomly spin if no biome is found or if it is unbound.
